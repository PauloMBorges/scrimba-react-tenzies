# Scrimba React Tenzies Game

This project is a tenzies game built as part of the [Scrimba's Learn React course](https://v2.scrimba.com/learn-react-c0e). 
The objective of the game is to roll dice until all dice show the same number. Players can freeze dice at their current value
by clicking on them. The game keeps track of the number of rolls and saves the best score on the local storage.

This was the capstone project of the course, and it worked as a review of all the concepts learned throughout the course.
